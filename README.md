Ever feel like your to-do list is a ticking time bomb? Well, now it *literally* is! Introducing **Time Bomb**, the most delightfully deranged timer app that will either supercharge your productivity or... well, let's just say your virtual files are about to experience some *explosive* changes. 😈

## What's the Fuss? (Or Should We Say, *Fuse*?) 🔥

Forget boring timers! Time Bomb simulates a high-stakes, deadline-driven environment where your precious (virtual) files hang in the balance. Set a timer, pretend you're working on something *super* important (like saving the world from a paperclip apocalypse), and if you don't finish before the kaboom... *poof*! Your progress starts vanishing like a donut at a cop convention. 🍩🚔

**Important Note:** This app doesn't *actually* delete your real files. It's a fun simulation, so relax and enjoy the chaos! (But maybe still finish your work, just in case... you never know.) 😉

## Key Features (Because We're Not *Completely* Insane) 🤪

* **Time Warp Customization:** Dial in your time limit with hours, minutes, and seconds. Because who needs sanity when you have deadlines?
* **Fake File Frenzy:** Enter a "working directory" (it's all make-believe, don't worry) and watch as the app conjures up a bunch of virtual files with progress versions.
* **Deletion Dance Party:** If you fail, witness the glorious spectacle of your virtual progress getting downgraded or straight-up deleted! It's like a reverse upgrade, but way more dramatic.
* **Bombastic Visuals:** A fiery bomb animation with a fuse that burns down as time runs out. Get ready for some serious suspense!
* **Warning Whimsy:** The timer turns a delightful shade of "oh-crap-red" when you're running low on time. And the bomb? It starts to jiggle like a caffeinated squirrel. 🐿️☕
* **Button Bonanza:** Start, stop, "oops-I-failed," and reset buttons for maximum control over the madness.
* **Mobile Mayhem:** Works on all your devices, so you can bring the chaos wherever you go!

## How to Play (Before Your Files Go *Boom*) 💥

1.  **Enter a "Working Directory" (Just Make Something Up):** It's all pretend, so have fun with it! "MySecretLair" or "TheLandOfUnicorns" are perfectly acceptable.
2.  **Set the Timer:** Choose your doom... I mean, duration.
3.  **Hit "Start Timer" and... WORK!:** Imagine the fate of the (virtual) world rests in your hands.
4.  **Finish? Great! Fail? Embrace the Chaos!:** Click "Not Done" and watch the fireworks.
5.  **Reset and Try Again:** Because everyone deserves a second chance... or a third, or a fourth...
